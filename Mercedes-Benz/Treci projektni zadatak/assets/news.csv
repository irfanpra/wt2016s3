The new GLE 450 AMG 4MATIC,Mercedes-AMG is extending its offering of AMG sports models. The GLE 450 AMG 4MATIC is already the third vehicle in this new line. The power SUV facilitates a further&#44; attractive way of entering the AMG performance world. The hallmark characteristics of the sports models include the enhanced engine output and the higher torque of the 3.0-liter V6 biturbo engine&#44; the specific AMG suspension&#44; the Sports Direct-Steer system&#44; the nine-stage automatic transmission 9G-TRONIC and the permanent all-wheel drive 4MATIC with the rear-biased torque distribution of 40:60. The new V6 top model of the GLE series facilitates impressive driving performance: acceleration&#44; handling and top speed are on a par with those of sports saloons.The new GLE 450 AMG 4MATIC impresses with agility and sportiness.

The new Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coup√©,Mercedes-AMG is setting a further landmark in the brand history: the new C 63 Coup√© is the next step on the way to yet more technical and visual distinctiveness. The far-reaching technical modifications are evident at first sight: strikingly flared front and rear wheel arches&#44; an increased track width and larger wheels give the Coup√© a muscular look while at the same time providing a basis for the highly agile longitudinal and lateral dynamics. The brand's typical "Driving Performance" is taken to new heights also with the C 63 Coup√©. The AMG 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine with 350 kW (476 hp) or 375 kW (510 hp) is just as much a completely in-house development from Affalterbach as&#44; for example&#44; the sophisticated AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension with electronically controlled shock absorbers&#44; the set-up of the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT transmission modes&#44; the rear-axle limited-slip differential or the dynamic engine mounts.         ,https://www.mercedes-amg.com/img/latest/news/20150820_ccoupe/main/01.jpg,22.05.2016 18:44:23
