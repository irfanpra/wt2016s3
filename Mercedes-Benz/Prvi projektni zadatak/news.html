        <h3> The new GLC 4MATIC </h3>
          <p>Mercedes-AMG is bringing two models from the C-Class performance family to the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. In addition to the C 43 4MATIC Coupé, the sports car and performance brand based in Affalterbach is now also showcasing the C 43 4MATIC Cabriolet. "The AMG product portfolio will continue to grow rapidly this year, making the world of Driving Performance more diverse than ever. Our new product line continues to expand at a fast pace and, with the C 43 4MATIC Cabriolet, we are offering a younger target group yet another alternative to discover the fascinating world of AMG," says Tobias Moers, Chief Executive of Mercedes AMG GmbH. 

          The 3.0-liter V6 biturbo engine in the new Cabriolet delivers impressive performance with its 270 kW (367 hp) maximum power and peak torque of 520 Nm: sprinting from rest to 100 km/h in 4.8 seconds, its speed is electronically limited at 250 km/h. The agile driving experience is mainly thanks to the standard-fit AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive with rear-biased torque distribution, the newly developed front axle, the stiff elastokinematics and the highly precise steering.

          18-inch AMG 5-spoke light-alloy wheels, painted in high-gloss black with a high-sheen finish
          AMG instrument cluster in checkered-flag design with 280 km/h scale and AMG main menu
          Multifunction sports steering wheel in leather with deep indentations in the grip area, flattened bottom section and red contrasting topstitching
          Upholstery in ARTICO man-made leather/DINAMICA microfiber in black with sports-seat look and red topstitching

        <h3> Two Powerhouses Roar into the Miami International Boat Show </h3>
          <p>Miami, FL/USA - Two legendary brands united once again at the Miami International Boat Show. Mercedes-AMG and Cigarette Racing joined forces for the sixth consecutive year to present the Cigarette Racing Team 41’ SD GT3 boat inspired by the Mercedes-AMG GT3 racecar. As the most powerful “open performance” boat ever produced by the Cigarette Racing Team, the 41’ SD GT3 marries the characteristic styling and thoroughbred motorsport technology of the Mercedes-AMG GT3 that was on display alongside it.

          Cutting-edge racing technology, awe inspiring performance and stunning design are all hallmarks of the Mercedes-AMG brand. Developed to comply with the FIA's GT3 race rules, the Mercedes-AMG GT3 competes in the world's most hotly contested customer race series. The GT3 racecar is based on the Mercedes-AMG GT S, which was launched in spring 2015 and established a new benchmark in the segment. The Mercedes-AMG GT S provided the ideal prerequisites for the GT3 racing model with its low centre of gravity, perfect distribution of weight and wide track width. This layout guarantees precise cornering properties, high lateral acceleration, first-class agility, a high level of traction and low inertia when having to change direction fast. On the different race circuits, all of these attributes give the driver the advantages necessary to achieve top placements.

          Powerful acceleration in the Mercedes-AMG GT3 is ensured by the seasoned and now further enhanced AMG 6.3-litre V8 engine taken from the SLS AMG GT3. User-friendly technology, excellent reliability, long maintenance intervals and low running costs made this high-revving, naturally aspirated engine the ideal choice for the new AMG customer sports model. Like the 7-Speed AMG SpeedShift Dual Clutch transmission in the GT S, the six-speed sequential racing gearbox in the GT3 is mounted in a transaxle configuration on the rear axle, thereby facilitating optimum weight distribution. The two high-performance models also have double-wishbone suspension that is made almost entirely from aluminium in common. These solutions once again demonstrate how closely linked regular production technology and racing technology are at AMG.

          “We are thrilled to partner with the Mercedes-Benz performance brand again this year to design our fastest open performance center console powerboat yet,” said Skip Braver, President and CEO of Cigarette Racing Team. “The 41’ SD GT3 embodies our brand’s commitment to innovation and craftsmanship and once again shows the strength of our collaboration with Mercedes-AMG.”

          The Cigarette Racing Team 41’ SD GT3 is powered by a pair of Mercury Racing 1100 HP engines with NXT6 Drives. The 41’ long and 11’ beam boat is able to achieve an estimated prop limited top speed of more than 100 mph with a focus on big water performance and weight of just over 20,000 lbs.

          The design and fittings reflect the dynamic characteristics of the Mercedes-AMG GT3. The handcrafted interior and exterior, featuring matte components, a complete teak wood floor and a full extreme marine grade leather interior - a first for Cigarette – was designed by Gorden Wagener and his team.

          “Mercedes-AMG and Cigarette Racing are known for iconic products”, said Gorden Wagener, Head of Design Daimler AG. “Designing the 41’ SD GT3 we used some unexpected design elements from our Mercedes-AMG GT3 to create another racing icon, the most powerful “open performance” boat ever produced by the Cigarette Racing Team.”

          User interface technology is also maximized with Bluetooth, computerized controls, three high-definition 17” displays, and the next generation integration of Garmin and Cigarette navigation and audio.

          Mercedes-AMG and Cigarette Racing began their collaboration partnership in 2007, primarily for organizing joint customer and marketing activities. Whether on land or water, Mercedes-AMG and Cigarette Racing are united by their focus on delivering the ultimate in performance. Similar to its Mercedes-AMG super sports counterpart, the 38’ to 50’ long powerboats from the American specialists are among the world's fastest and most exclusive machines. These boats feature custom-made, handcrafted quality for enthusiasts and are tested under the most extreme conditions. Mercedes-AMG and Cigarette Racing share similar DNA makeups: both companies have triumphant racing roots and are still dedicated to this passion. </p>

        <h3> Exclusive A-Class </h3>
          <p>Affalterbach. It doesn't get any better: with victory in the constructors' world championship as well as the drivers' championship plus runner-up titles clocked up by Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team has achieved the ultimate in motorsport's champion’s league in 2015. To mark the end of the season Mercedes-AMG is celebrating this outstanding team achievement with an exclusive special model: the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS 2015 World Champion Edition of the A 45 4MATIC blends the expressive Formula 1 look of the victorious Silver Arrows with particularly extensive and unique equipment. A Silver Arrow for everyday: with the ingenious streamlining package, the large 19 inch wheels and the characteristic foiling the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS 2015 World Champion Edition is taking the Formula 1 success from the race track to the road. "With the World Champion Edition we would like to share with our customers our delight and pride in the strong performance of the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team," said Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG. "This is a way for every fan to share the success of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg."</p>

        <h3> The new Mercedes-AMG C 63 Coupé </h3>
          <p>Affalterbach. Mercedes-AMG is setting a further landmark in the brand history: the new C 63 Coupé is the next step on the way to yet more technical and visual distinctiveness. The far-reaching technical modifications are evident at first sight: strikingly flared front and rear wheel arches, an increased track width and larger wheels give the Coupé a muscular look while at the same time providing a basis for the highly agile longitudinal and lateral dynamics. The brand's typical "Driving Performance" is taken to new heights also with the C 63 Coupé. The AMG 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine with 350 kW (476 hp) or 375 kW (510 hp) is just as much a completely in-house development from Affalterbach as, for example, the sophisticated AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension with electronically controlled shock absorbers, the set-up of the AMG DYNAMIC SELECT transmission modes, the rear-axle limited-slip differential or the dynamic engine mounts. </p>
